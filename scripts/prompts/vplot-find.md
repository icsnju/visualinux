I have a gdb-based tool for Linux kernel debugging. Now the user wants to choose some fields of a given object. The following lists several predefined field set, each entry defines a set of fields and has a short description about the characteristics of the fields. The key of each entry is a pair of strings.

!!!TYPEMAP!!!

I will give you a message which describes some characteristics about the expected fields. You should choose an entry from the list which best fits the description. You should print only the key of chosen entry, without quotes or any other description or explanation.
